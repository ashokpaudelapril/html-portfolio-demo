<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hi! My name is Ashok Paudel. I am a freshman at Texas State University majoring at Electrical Engineering 
  (Computer engineering Concentration). I am very new to web development. My curiosity about coding and computers 
  got me to computer engineering along with electrical engineering. I love electronics items and coding. I can spend 
  hours on computers and exploring about them.

<p>My passion for computers and electronics items was from a very early age. My interest in coding began when I started 
  learning about QBASIC in grade 8. I also got some exposure of HTML in grade 9. I had no idea what it is, why it is used, but 
  I was good in HTML. After grade 9, my study was more focused on more theoritical subjects like maths, physics, chemistry.
  During our high school, we were taught about C++, but I was totally balnk about why they were teaching us. They just taught 
  us to copy code nothing else.

<p>After my high school, I again got idea to explore python. I was still feel where I am while learning about Python, but 
I was determined that I will explore. As I started exploring, I found how python is used for automation, and I got some really
good stuff to explore. Everyday the motivation was there that someday I own my own can create automation. As I learn more and 
more about coding and computers, I am more excited to learn what is really inside that small balck box that can do a whole lots of things.
