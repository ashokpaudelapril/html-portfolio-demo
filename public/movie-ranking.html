<h1>The Best Movies According to Ashok</h1>
<h2>My top 3 movies of all-time.</h2>
<hr />
<h3>Shawshank Redemption</h3>
<p>This is one of my favourite. I can relate this with coding as well. While coding whenever I got struck somewhere and can 
    not find a way out, I remember a famous dialogue from this movie. Do not try to escape the prison,instead slowly slowly try to dig a 
    tunnel. It will take time, but eventually at the end of the tunnel, you will see the light. Do not rush when you are trouble, most of 
    us just want to be free, but it is not that easy it will take time, effort. The only thing that you can do is keep digging the 
    tunnel; You will eventually find a way out.

<h3>Inseperable You</h3>
<p>It is movie that i watched recently. I just love the movie, and how it protray what life is, what love is. It is available 
    on Netflix. I just do not want to give spoilers, so go watch that movie.

<h3>Aama</h3>
<p>It is a Nepali movie. It almost made me cry. It shows a harsh reality of materialistic society. There were a lot of issues 
    that were discussed in this movie. I would recommend to watch it once fif you can understand Nepali language.
